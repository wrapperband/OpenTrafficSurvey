#Open Traffic Survey#
**Introduction to a citizen Traffic Survey Methodology**

The aim of Open Traffic Survey is to outline a procedure which retains un-tamperable (video) evidence of Traffic characteristics and provide an open source spreadsheet into which data can be input and visualised with charts.  This survey is the result of a number of weeks work recording traffic and noise levels at the Oldham test site. These results were analysed in depth and a resulting updated Traffic Survey template spreadsheet was produced for 5 minute surveys. 

Previous results had shown better than 25% error when predicting vehicles per hour (VPH) from vehicles per 5 minutes of flow readings. It was already shown from the 2013 test site survey traffic surveys that the site has reasonably consistent flow of traffic from  07:00 till 19:00. Other sites might have more "lumpy" traffic flows and require longer surveys. It is recommended to uses 2 * 5 minute surveys, it has been found that these are time consuming, but more managable than a full 10 minute or longer survey. 

If you are using the Template to investigate a new Traffic flow test site, it is good practice to get a set of baseline readings at various times of the day. For instance, say 4 * 5 minute surveys would give a good indication of the variability. This would show how the new site differs from the template site, in order to understand which measurements need to be taken to describe the new site. i.e to capture the peak or lowest flow / congestion / speed times from observation.

**Summery :**  

The spreadsheet TrafficAnalysisSpreadsheet.Noise.5MinuteSurvey.Template.-17.40-07.03.2016-01.ods shows real data from the Oldham Test site and can also be used as an 5 minute traffic survey Template.  

TrafficDataCollectionMethodology.md  explains how the data was collected and the equipment used.  

TrafficDataAnalysisMethodology.md shows how the data was analysed in the spreadsheet.  

The README.md document records the main conclusions and observations and pertenant charts taken from the three traffic surveys.  


#Conclusions and Observations  

Manual observation of the noise indicates the major source of traffic noise is due to wheel noise in this case. The traffic is mainly free flowing and is not generally deccelerating or accelerating where the readings are taken.

The secondary noise in this case appears to be from exhaust noise, indicated by the tendency for noise to be greater measured behind the vehicles.

In other cercumstances, where vehicles are starting and stopping or struggling up hill then engine and exhaust noise would probably dominate.

The calibration survey 01 showed that is a relation ship between speed and noise.

It was noted that the readings from dBC and dBA were not that disimillar for traffic noise. For traffic noise a simple dBC meter can give a genuine indication liable effect.

The base noise level at the test site is extremely low, less than 40 dBA. It is well known that noise is more intrusive when compared against low background levels.

The highest levels of noise observered were for noisy vehicles, such as tractors and busses. Peak Noise levels for these vehicles often exceeded 85 dBA.

Noise levels when buses passed each other (a not too unlikely event) noise levels exceeded 90 dBA.

Noise levels remained high for significant periods of time / distance as vehicles passed. A number of estimation methos were tested whcih showed levels of noise 30 to 40 dB over backgroung for significant periods of the day. The test also showed peak levels above 75 dBA for significant portions of the sample times.

This chart from Survey 01 on the 2nd March 2016 at 12:15 shows the level of Noise dBC against traffic flow. It can be clearly seen the effect of traffic noise and how that becomes continuously high as flow rates increase.
