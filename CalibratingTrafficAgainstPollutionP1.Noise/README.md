#Open Traffic Survey#
**Introduction to a citizen Traffic Survey Methodology**

The aim of Open Traffic Survey is to outline a procedure which retains un-tamperable (video) evidence of Traffic characteristics and provide an open source spreadsheet into which data can be input and visualised with charts.  This survey is the result of a number of weeks work recording traffic and noise levels at the Oldham test site. These results were analysed in depth and a resulting updated Traffic Survey template spreadsheet was produced for 5 minute surveys. 

The choice of a 5 minute survey arrives from previous survey results showning better than 25% error when predicting vehicles per hour (VPH) from vehicles per 5 minutes of flow readings. It was already shown from the 2013 test site survey traffic surveys, that the site has reasonably consistent flow of traffic from  07:00 till 19:00. Other sites might have more "lumpy" traffic flows and require longer surveys. It is recommended to uses 2 * 5 minute surveys, it has been found that these are time consuming, but more managable than a full 10 minute or longer survey. 

If you are using the Template to investigate a new Traffic flow test site, it is good practice to get a set of baseline readings at various times of the day. For instance, say 4 * 5 minute surveys would give a good indication of the variability. This would show how the new site differs from the template site, in order to understand which measurements need to be taken to describe the new site. i.e to capture the peak or lowest flow / congestion / speed times from observation.

The spreadsheet TrafficAnalysisSpreadsheet.Noise.5MinuteSurvey.Template.-17.40-07.03.2016-01.ods shows real data from the Oldham Test site and can also be used as an 5 minute traffic survey Template.  

TrafficDataCollectionMethodology.md  explains how the data was collected and the equipment used.  

TrafficDataAnalysisMethodology.md shows how the data was analysed in the spreadsheet.  

The README.md document records the main conclusions and observations and pertenant charts taken from the three traffic surveys.  


#Conclusions and Observations  

Manual observation of the noise indicates the major source of traffic noise is due to wheel noise in this case. The traffic is mainly free flowing and is not generally deccelerating or accelerating where the readings are taken.  

The secondary noise in this case appears to be from exhaust noise, indicated by the tendency for noise to be greater measured behind the vehicles.  

In other cercumstances, where vehicles are starting and stopping or struggling up hill then engine and exhaust noise would probably dominate.  

The calibration survey 01 showed that is a relation ship between speed and noise.  

It was noted that the readings from dBC and dBA were not that disimillar for traffic noise. For traffic noise a simple dBC meter can give a genuine indication liable effect.

The base noise level at the test site is extremely low, less than 40 dBA. It is well known that noise is more intrusive when compared against low background levels.  

The highest levels of noise observered were for noisy vehicles, such as tractors and busses. Peak Noise levels for these vehicles often exceeded 85 dBA.  

Noise levels when buses passed each other (a not too unlikely event) noise levels exceeded 90 dBA.  

Noise levels remained high for significant periods of time / distance as vehicles passed. A number of estimation methos were tested whcih showed levels of noise 30 to 40 dB over backgroung for significant periods of the day. The test also showed peak levels above 75 dBA for significant portions of the sample times.

This chart from Survey 01 on the 2nd March 2016 at 12:15 shows the level of Noise in dBC against traffic flow. It can be clearly seen the effect of traffic on noise and how that becomes noise continuously high as flow rates increase.

This chart from Survey 01 on the 2nd March 2016 at 12:15 shows the levels of noise from the full survey. 

The noise levels of each of the noise bands were allocated for the 410 readings of dBC taken during the 5 minute sample time. If the dBC was above a value that reading was allocated with number 1, zero if bellow. The percentage in each range was then totalled as a percentage of all the readings.  

As can be seen during the detailed test on Saturday 02-03-2016 at 12:15 with a relatively low VPH of 360, the noise levels were above 80 dBC for 50% of the time. Calibration of the dBC meter for traffic noise against dBA shows that would indicate noise levels of 75 dB for 50% of the time.  

The minimum sound level recorded on 02-03-2016 shows another disturbing aspect of the noise. It is well known that impulsive or changing noises are found more disturbing, and that noises above a low threshold are also more disturbing. In the test case the noise level varied from it's low of 43.7 dBC through to a peak of 93.1 dBC through an average of 74 dBC.

This chart shows from  12:15 02-03-2016 shows the noise levels measured as vehicles entered and exited the measurement box. This shows that the effect of the noise of the vehicle is extended over the 25 yards of measurement. It can be seen that the noise increases as vehicles aproach and can increase further from exhaust noise, when individual vehicles passing were studied.

The analysis of vehicle seperation against safe stopping distance for the 12:15 02-03-2016 survey showed the most dangerous times for vehicles were when they were being slowed in congestion.  That is the time when vehicles are travelling at or above the safe stopping distance for their speed. 

The danger of congestion had been noted in previous surveys but flow rates were only being estimated from an average of each way traffic, so the new surveys included a methodology to split the in and out traffic by sorting and coping the frames and other data into a new section of the spreadsheet for In and Out traffic. A lot of work was also done to update all the charts with relevent In Out data where applicable.

Time between vehicles has been added to the new template spreadsheet.

In the Noise test case, it had already established that large vehicles need special measures, like turning circles, to be able to operate. It is established in planning that new developments reduce danger entering the road by improving line of site. 

Yet at the same time the planning process has allowed accelerated development of the area and left some residents to feel the brunt of the over use of limited infrastrucure, such as narrow roads with no pavment or off road parking.

Clearly the Planning process needs a review as it is not acting in the best interest of all parties when alloating infrastrucure access. In particular, the test case shows the planning process is either un-aware of the danger of increasing traffic to current residence or ignoring that for the benefit of developers.

The new charts of exact time between vehicles is now possible with the new spreadsheet. This one is from 12:15 02-03-2016. The time between vehicles was further reduced when the evening of 07-03-2016 was surveyed the average time between vehicles dropped to a 7 second average. It was also noted further information was available on wait times to exit, for instance there were extended periods in all surveys where time between vihicles is less than 7 seconds....
