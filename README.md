The Open Traffic Survey is the result of "6 years work" (not contiguous) monitoring and analysing the traffic on a minor road in Oldham.  It arises from long term notes on how AI techniques could assist in continuous environmental surveys such as traffic levels and the requirement of a local planning action group to have some source of "provable in court" information on the environment and how it was changing.

The Open Traffic Survey does this by outlining a procedure which retains un-tamperable video evidence. It then shows how to easily input that information into an open source spreadsheet. In the spreadsheet there are a number of calculations and charts that can be produced automatically. The "Open Traffic Survey" is conceived as part of Open condition Monitoring Tools, which are part of Open Governance systems.

**Hardware Set-up**

USB digital camera or other video camera

Computer to analyse data

1 yard stick

**Software Requirement**

Avidemux video editor

LibreOffice Spreadsheet software


**Open Traffic Survey - Methodology**  

Position the camera at a suitable place to video record the traffic, preferably side on.  
  
Should the positioning be restrictive a wide angle lens can be used to increase the analysis distance travelled by the cars.  

Record video of the traffic.  

For a high rate of traffic, i.e. greater than 300 vehicles an hour, this would be about 10 minutes, for manual analysis.  

It is not necessary to take high resolution video, 640 x 480 is fine to identify when a car is entering.  

It is advisable to keep additional video evidence for later analysis, if necessary.  

**Measuring the distance travelled**

Using the yardstick (I manufactured one from a mop/broom handle), measure the distance on the pavement of the street being monitored. I was able to measure 25yards from one side of the video image to the other.  

**Measuring the time for a vehicle to travel a set distance**

The video can now be analysed using an editor such as Avidemux.  

As each vehicle enters the frame, the spreadsheet is updated with the frame number from the video.  

Various lengths and frame rates were tested, it was possible to get accurate results, with calculated error levels with 25 yards measurement and a 5 frames per second video.
