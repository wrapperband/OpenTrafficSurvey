#Open Traffic Survey
**Introduction to a citizen Traffic Survey Methodology**

The Open Traffic Survey is the result of "6 years work" (not contiguous) monitoring and analysing the traffic on a minor road in Oldham.  

The methodology arises from long term notes on how A.I. or Machine Learning techniques could assist in continuous environmental surveys such as traffic levels. 

The necessity to start manual analysis and record keeping arose out of the requirement of a local planning action group to have some source of "provable in court" information on the environment and how it was changing. That investigation resulted in various charts and calculations to show/ visualise the true effect of "average vehicle flows" being experienced. 

It was also envisaged that the system could be used to confirm or refute the error levels of "official data" collected at the time. In the test case where Traffic readings were taken at a non standard road position which would emphasis the low speed under counting, inherent in low cost "Traffic Speed Surveys" systems when calculating "Traffic Flow Rates".

This chart is from the first spreadsheet with data taken from Video evidence, then manually counting the number of vehicles into  each hour "pot". A time consuming, but satisfying task as it dispelled pre-conceived ideas of what the traffic flows were. Evidence of high traffic levels on weekends and holidays dispelled the myth that heavier traffic in the week could be allowed as there is respite at the weekend, for instance .....

Various techniques and common equipment were tested for potential use as sensors and analysis to speed up the time consuming process. 

In the 2015 survey, a triggering mechanism was used to save a single or small number of stills as each vehicle passing, which could be simply counted as the number of files in a folder for that time period. 

This proved effective for long term monitoring, it was used to prove there was no early morning or  early evening peak in traffic in our case. The drawback was it had to be a significant calibration as it under estimated the traffic by 1/3 for the flow and possible set up of the trigger. At the traffic flow of one car every 12 seconds (8 till 8), the calibration will be lower for lower flows.

However, the trigger method was surprisingly accurate  for such a large calibration, when sample tested with a video count..

Examination of the video evidence, compared to the triggered photo method showed the reasons why it underestimates the flow ... 

1. At the traffic levels on the road, traffic was often bunched <  less than the re-trigger time for the system.
2. Vehicles often passed in opposite directions at that point in the road ( between parked cars) only triggering one event.


The Open Traffic Survey aim is to outline a procedure which retains un-tamperable (video) evidence of Traffic. 

It then provides an open source spreadsheet which data can be input. In the spreadsheet there are a number of calculations and charts that can be produced automatically. 

The "Open Traffic Survey" is conceived as part of Open Condition Monitoring Tools, which is also conceived as open source tools to enable to enable the public to run easily audit-able "Open Governance Systems" or "Government monitoring systems".
