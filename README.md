#Open Traffic Survey
**Introduction to a citizen Traffic Survey Methodology**

The aim of Open Traffic Survey is to outline a procedure which retains un-tamperable (video) evidence of Traffic characteristics and provide an open source spreadsheet into which data can be input and visualised with charts.  

**Open Traffic Survey : History of development**

The Open Traffic Survey is the result of "6 years work" (not contiguous) monitoring and analysing the traffic on a minor road in Oldham.  

The methodology arises from long term notes / study of how A.I. or Machine Learning techniques could assist in continuous environmental surveys such as traffic levels. i.e. it is an open source project to enable Environmental monitoring, contributions welcome.

The necessity to start manual analysis and record keeping arose out of the requirement of a local planning action group to have some source of "provable in court" information on the environment and how it was changing. That investigation resulted in various charts and calculations to show/ visualise the true effect of "average vehicle flows" being experienced by the community. 

It was also envisaged that the system could be used to confirm or refute the error levels of "official data" collected at the time. In the test case where Traffic readings were taken at a non standard road position which would emphasis the low speed under counting, a known source of inherent error when using the low cost "Traffic Speed Surveys" systems for calculating "Traffic Flow Rates".

This chart is from the first spreadsheet with data taken from Video evidence, then manually counting the number of vehicles into  each hour "pot". A time consuming, but satisfying task as it dispelled pre-conceived ideas of what the traffic flows were. Evidence of high traffic levels on weekends and holidays dispelled the myth that heavier traffic in the week could be allowed as there is respite at the weekend, for instance .....

**Open Traffic Survey : Observations and Results from Test Surveys**

Various techniques and common equipment were tested for potential use as sensors and analysis to speed up the time consuming parts of the process of auditing traffic levels. 

In the 2015 survey, a triggering mechanism was used to save a single or small number of stills as each vehicle passing, which could be simply counted as the number of files in a folder for that time period. 

This proved effective for long term monitoring, it was used to prove there was no early morning or  early evening peak in traffic in our case. The drawback with the video image triggering method it had to be subject a significant calibration. Although it was consistent it under estimated the traffic by 1/3. (With a traffic flow of one car every 12 seconds) The calibration may be lower for lower flows, but meant the values need to be multiplied by 3 to get the actual figure. 

However, the video trigger method was surprisingly accurate,  for a method which required such a large calibration factor, when sample tested with a manual count of traffic from a video ..

Examination of the video evidence, compared to the triggered photo method showed the reasons why it underestimates the flow ... 

1. At the traffic levels on the road, traffic was often bunched <  less than the re-trigger time for the system.
2. Vehicles often passed in opposite directions at that point in the road ( between parked cars) only triggering one event.

**Estimating the level of pollution from the Traffic Flows recorded**

"How Polluted is my road?" is a web site that shows official statistics and analysis of pollution in London obtained by "Clean Air in London" from Transport for London.

http://www.howpollutedismyroad.org.uk/ : shows some research information to help calibrate pollution levels from Traffic flow rate data :  


    "Are there more than 10,000 vehicles a day?"  

    "Scientific research suggests that living near roads travelled by more than 10,000 vehicles per day  
     could be responsible for some 15-30% of all new cases of asthma in children, and a similar proportion    
     of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and CHD (coronary heart disease)  
     cases in adults 65 years of age and older."  
  
    If you click on a section of road you'll see lots of detailed information on the pollutants,  
    plus the number of vehicle movements per day."   

For the Traffic survey test site there were 310 vehicles per hour for 12 hours, that is over 3,700 vehicles a day. It is therefore clear adjacency of the road and the steep sided valley means the residence are already being exposed to dangerous levels of pollution, without further increases in development / Traffic . The proposed development threatening to increase the daily levels above 5200. 
However, the current research shows average readings vastly underestimate the peak levels. The simulated traffic for the period the development would use, showed peak levels of 10,000 per hour, for one event in the 10 minute sample and for over 3000 vehicles per hour for 3 events over 30 seconds long ....

**Open Source Systems : Philosophy**

The "Open Traffic Survey" is conceived as part of Open Condition Monitoring Tools, which is also conceived as open source tools to enable to enable the public to run easily audit-able "Open Governance Systems" or "Government monitoring systems".

  1. Open Governance  
    1. https://github.com/MrChrisJ/World-Citizenship  
    2. https://github.com/wrapperband/Open-Condition-Monitoring  
      1.  Traffic flow estimator   

Open Governance is used to describe tools that might be used to provide facilities, normally provided by Governments, to those in the World without that infrastructure.  

It can also be seen as technology to remove as many areas from "human trust" to "trust systems" that are outside the bounds of normal human manipulation. For instance, Bitcoin Blockchain attempts to take the release of new capital / money out of "human hands" and release it at a standard level without "inflation". In the Bitcoin trustless system money can not be simply "printed" for short term political purpose.

It well known that humans do not have full conscious control of all of their actions, it is unfair to tempt the unconscious, which is working at lower animal level and doesn't understand the ethics when tempted.  The human sub conscious can see a minor error could end in their favour might make it without the conscious even knowing. This is why entrapment of any type should be illegal in any civilised society, anyone can be entrapped.

**Monitoring "Trusted Systems"**

"Trustless systems" can therefore be used to audit "Trusted systems". 

In order to achieve that trust with "trusted systems"  it will be important that the general citizen can reproduce the work of the "Public Servant", in order that the effect  of work can be monitored. Currently the political systems in most countries have evolved to better serve those at the top, mainly by obscuring any cause and effect or over complicating regulation as there is no feedback or normal quality control or improvement.

**Possible future development**

https://github.com/delsmith/Traffic-Survey-Development

This Github contains a reversed engineered version of "Traffic Speed Survey" software used by standard equipment in countries. It would be possible to convert data from the counter to be input into the spreadsheet and vice versa.

The possibility of using information from other sensors such as Wi-Fi interference, noise monitoring, Kinect, motion detector for instance, and having a system to store / analyse that data.  

Developing and training an A.I. to automatically analyse incoming traffic data and simulate the various calculations in real time.
  
Add additional calculations, for instance the vehicle flows could be calibrated to show pollution levels.
