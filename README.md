#Open Traffic Survey
**Introduction to a citizen Traffic Survey Methodology**

The Open Traffic Survey is the result of "6 years work" (not contiguous) monitoring and analysing the traffic on a minor road in Oldham.  It arises from long term notes on how AI techniques could assist in continuous environmental surveys such as traffic levels and the requirement of a local planning action group to have some source of "provable in court" information on the environment and how it was changing.

The Open Traffic Survey does this by outlining a procedure which retains un-tamperable video evidence. It then shows how to easily input that information into an open source spreadsheet. In the spreadsheet there are a number of calculations and charts that can be produced automatically. The "Open Traffic Survey" is conceived as part of Open Condition Monitoring Tools, which is also conceived as open source tools to enable to enable the public to run easily audit-able "Open Governance Systems" or "Government monitoring systems".
