# OpenTrafficSurvey
**Methodology for automating a citizen traffic survey**

Over the years, I have been studying a number of areas I have previous expertise in, in particular, how they will develop in the new open source environment. 

For example like I contributed some ideas and testing to, World Citizenship, started by a fellow Feathercoin member, and what that achieved in co-operative development.

Free, open source solutions are now starting to take over proprietary solutions, and not just computers ...for instance open source text books.

These are the "Open Governance" Ideas I personally have been making notes on / thinking about how to implement :

  OpenLocalForums
  OpenConditonMonitoring
    Traffic flow estimator

The Open Traffic Survey is the result of "6 years work" (not contiguous) monitoring and analysing the traffic on a minor road in Oldham.  It arises from long term notes on using AI to do environmental surveys, such as traffic and the requirement of a local planning action group to have some source of "provable in court" information on the environment and how it was changing.

The Open Traffic Survey does this by outline a procedure which retains un-tamperable video evidence, and shows how to easily input that information into an open source spreadsheet. There are a number of calculations and charts can be produced automatically.

Hopeful it'll get some Git pushs from others to refining the spreadsheets further and do a provable (includes video proof) citizen traffic survey.
