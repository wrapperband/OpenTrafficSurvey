There were 6 occasions of about 1000 vehicles per hour, 10 cases where traffic was over 700 in the first hour. The road was observably congested, as can be seen from the chart, large increase in traffic is due to batch queuing.

This case was novel in that congestio continued over 2 blocks of 10 cars on 2 occasions
