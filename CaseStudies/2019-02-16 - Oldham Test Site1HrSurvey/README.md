### Results of 1 Hour 20 mins Vehicle Survey - Diggle 16/2/2019 12:15

445    - Average Vehicles Per Hour Survey  

The charts show a continuing average based on the 1st hour count, for an extra 20mins.


The traffic level was down the 500's, but is still close to "rush hour traffic" levels, noise and congestion.


There were 4 occasions of over 1300 vehicles per hour. The road was observably congested, as can be seen from the chart, large increase in traffic is due to batch queuing.

There were 2 of those occasions when traffic was above 1700 vehicles per hour. From observing the traffic video this level of traffic is already causing sever congestion, pollution and noise in the narrow road.  

The average after the 1hour count survey was completed shows continuing sever levels of traffic.
