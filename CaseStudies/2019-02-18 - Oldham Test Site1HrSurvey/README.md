### Results of 1 Hour 20 mins Vehicle Survey - Diggle 18/2/2019 10:15 - 12:15

375    - For First Hour of Survey Average Vehicles Per Hour Survey  

The charts show a continuing average based on the 1st hour count, for an extra 20mins.


The traffic level was down from the "rush hour"  500 vehicles per hour at 10:00am, but is still close to "rush hour traffic" levels, noise and congestion.


There were 1 occasions of about 1000 vehicles per hour, 2 cases where traffic was over 700 in the first hour. The road was observably congested, as can be seen from the chart, large increase in traffic is due to batch queuing.

The traffic was above 500 vehicles per hour  for about a third of the time. From observing the traffic video this level of traffic is already causing sever congestion, pollution and noise in the narrow road. It can be seen that there are less peaks in traffic over 1000, for 375 vehicles per hour and the the increasing number of peaks as the traffic level increases (above about 270) shows Sever congestion, ie. more than 50% traffic has to  stop to allow oncoming traffic past on the narrow road. 

The average after the 1hour count survey was completed shows continuing sever levels of traffic. It can be seen where small increases in traffic causes bunching.

The survey shows there are high levels of traffic for the road and lack of regulation pavements, even at "non rush hour times".
